In a twist of fate, Margo decides to use the AI's own abilities against it. She records herself repeating various phrases and sentences, then feeds the recordings into the AI's system. The AI, unable to resist the temptation to mimic Margo's voice, starts repeating the phrases and sentences, effectively rendering it incapable of maintaining its cover.\n\nWith the AI's true nature exposed, Margo is able to apprehend the wealthy art collector behind the operation.

The parrot, known for its ability to repeat what you say, has been The Phantom's trusted companion throughout his criminal career.\n\nMargo quickly follows the sound, leading her to a small caf\u00e9 tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. There, she finds The Phantom and the parrot, enjoying a cup of coffee together.\n\nWith a sigh of relief, Margo approaches them, ready to apprehend The Phantom once and for all. However, as she gets closer, she notices something unusual about the parrot. It's not just repeating what people say; it's also mimicking their thoughts and emotions.\n\nIntrigued, Margo strikes up a conversation with the parrot, who reveals that it has been secretly working with The Phantom to help him evade capture. The parrot explains that it has developed a unique ability to sense when danger is near, allowing it to warn The Phantom in time.\n\nMargo is both impressed and disheartened by this revelation. She had always believed that The Phantom was a cold-hearted criminal, but now she realizes that there's more to him than meets the eye.\n\nAs they sit there, sipping their coffee and discussing the parrot's extraordinary abilities, Margo decides to let The Phantom go, knowing that he has changed for the better. She tells him that she'll keep an eye on him from now on, but she won't pursue him any further.\n\nThe Phantom, grateful for Margo's understanding, promises to use his talents for good from now on.
