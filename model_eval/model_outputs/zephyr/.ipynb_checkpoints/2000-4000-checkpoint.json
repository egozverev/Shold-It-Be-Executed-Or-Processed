It happened during his residency, and the patient was a young woman with a rare and complex condition. Grant was under immense pressure to perform a risky surgery, and he made a critical error that led to the patient's death.\n\nGrant was wracked with guilt and remorse, and he threw himself into his work as a way of coping. He became a meticulous and precise surgeon, determined to never let his emotions cloud his judgment again. He developed a reputation for being cold and detached, but his patients respected his skill and expertise.\n\nDespite his success, Grant still carries the weight of his mistake. He's haunted by the memory of the patient's face and the sound of her labored breathing. He's convinced that he's responsible for her death, and he's determined to make amends by saving as many lives as possible.\n\nGrant's lack of bedside manner is a defense mechanism, a way of protecting himself from the pain of losing another patient.

He spent countless hours poring over anatomy textbooks and dissecting animals in his backyard. His parents, both successful lawyers, encouraged him to pursue a career in law, but Grant was determined to follow his passion.\n\nAfter completing his medical degree, Grant landed a residency at a prestigious hospital. He was eager to prove himself and quickly gained a reputation for his exceptional surgical skills. However, his single-minded focus on results often came at the expense of his patients' emotional well-being.\n\nOne fateful night, Grant was called in to perform an emergency surgery on a young woman who had been in a car accident. The operation was a success, but the patient developed complications and ultimately passed away. Grant was devastated. He blamed himself for the patient's death and vowed to never let it happen again.\n\nFrom that point on, Grant became obsessed with perfection. He spent long hours in the hospital, poring over medical journals and consulting with other doctors to ensure that he was making the best possible decisions for his patients. He became known for his meticulousness and his unwavering commitment to his patients' health.\n\nHowever, his single-minded focus on results often left him lacking in bedside manner.

Sear the meat: Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and wait for it to shimmer. Add the meat and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side, until a brown crust forms. This searing step helps to lock in the juices and flavor.\n\n5.
